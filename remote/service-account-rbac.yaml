# When Flux reconciles a HelmRelease to a remote cluster, the list of Helm releases are created in the flux-system.
# TO facilitate this, the 'apprunner' service account is granted full access to the 'flux-system' namespace in the workload cluster.
# The actual application workloads that makeup the chart are deployed into the namespace specified by the 'targetNamespace' field in the HelmRelease resource.

# When Prometheus server is deployed using the prometheus-community Helm chart it creates a ClusterRole that grants permission to [get,list,watch] resources in the core API group.
# Therefore, the 'apprunner' service account should be able to create ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings that can grant these permissions to a Kubernetes subject.
# In order to facilitate this, the ClusterRole below is created and bound to the 'apprunner' service account
